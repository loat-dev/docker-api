/**
 * @title Docker Engine API
 * @version 1.51
 * @baseUrl /v1.51
 *
 * The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the
 * Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker
 * client can do can be done with the API.
 *
 * Most of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps`
 * is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers,
 * which consists of several API calls.
 *
 * # Errors
 *
 * The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
 * of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following
 * format:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "message": "page not found"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * # Versioning
 *
 * The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to
 * ensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API,
 * you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use
 * the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in
 * the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message
 * is returned.
 *
 * If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.50) is used.
 * For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.51/info`. Using the
 * API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
 *
 * Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API,
 * so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.
 *
 * The API uses an open schema model, which means the server may add extra properties
 * to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and
 * request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional
 * properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer
 * daemons.
 *
 *
 * # Authentication
 *
 * Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send
 * authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with
 * registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as
 * `X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)
 * (JSON) string with the following structure:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "username": "string",
 *   "password": "string",
 *   "serveraddress": "string"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this
 * structure, double quotes are required.
 *
 * If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth),
 * you can just pass this instead of credentials:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "identitytoken": "9cbaf023786cd7..."
 * }
 * ```

    /**
     * @description Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers that have been detached. Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint to do anything. See the [documentation for the `docker attach` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/) for more details. ### Hijacking This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` on the same socket. This is the response from the daemon for an attach request: ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream [STREAM] ``` After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server. To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client can also optionally send connection upgrade headers. For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection: ``` POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1 Upgrade: tcp Connection: Upgrade ``` The Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will similarly follow with the raw stream: ``` HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream Connection: Upgrade Upgrade: tcp [STREAM] ``` ### Stream format When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream and the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each containing a header and a payload. The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in the last four bytes (`uint32`). It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this: ```go header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4} ``` `STREAM_TYPE` can be: - 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`) - 1: `stdout` - 2: `stderr` `SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size encoded as big endian. Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`. The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following: 1. Read 8 bytes. 2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte. 3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes. 4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output. 5. Goto 1. ### Stream format when using a TTY When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's `stdin`.
